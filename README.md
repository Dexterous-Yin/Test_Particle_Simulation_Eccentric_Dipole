# Code for "Transient Distortions of the South Atlantic Anomaly Radiation Environments Driven by Electric Fields"

This repository contains the simulation codes used in the study:
> **Transient Distortions of the South Atlantic Anomaly Radiation Environments Driven by Electric Fields**  
> Authors: Ze-Fan Yin et al.

The codes conduct test-particle simulations in an eccentric dipole magnetic field to reproduce the main results and figures presented in the paper.
